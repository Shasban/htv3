# Interview with Silvia Eldawi

#### Director Property Management at Driven Properties.

<br>
In an interview with Silvia Eldawi, Director Property Management at Driven Properties she highlighted the importance of Property management system in today’s era in enabling the business to come out of the traditional process of maintaining confusing spreadsheets, numerous phone calls and filing bundles and bundles of documents.

“HappyTenant has helped improve transparency levels and communication between property managers and tenants, which is something the market has been missing for years. As a leading property management platform, with over 5,000 units under management in Dubai and Ajman, and a portfolio value in excess of AED 8 billion, HappyTenant has helped improve not only the tenant’s experience in Dubai, but also the owners’ reporting metrics. This matches our vision, which is all about technology, automation, and disruption" added Silvia Eldawi, Director Property Management at Driven Properties.
