#### Press Release

Gone are the days of confusing spread sheets, messy sticky notes, angry tenant calls and ungainly wall notices as part of daily property management activities. Instead, 'HappyTenant' Application, a new all-in-one cloud-based solution assures absolute happiness and peace of mind for both the real estate management company as well as the tenant. It combines the best advanced technology to seamlessly integrate all aspects of property management into a simplified, accurate and easily trackable real-time information interface that can be conveniently viewed both on computers as well as smart phones.

'HappyTenant' Application has arrived at a time when UAE is moving towards making happiness a national policy, guided by the vision of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of UAE and Ruler of Dubai, and the strong commitment demonstrated by the UAE leadership.

'HappyTenant' is a full property management system that allows property agents to take control of all the day-to-day activities related to their properties and tenants, through one account and a single login. It not only enhances productivity by reducing the administrative work smartly, by improving the workflow, but also optimizes business operations by providing easy access and better communication with tenants.

"Automation is the future and Customers are the key to success of any business. 'HappyTenant' is easy to use, secure and tenants will surely appreciate its efficiency in solving their property issues instantly on daily basis. In the long run, a happy and satisfied tenant means sustainable business for Real Estate Companies" said Joe Moufarrej, Co-Founder & CEO of 'Happy Tenant' Application.

Real estate companies can choose a host of pocket friendly plans and then share the 'HappyTenant' Application with their tenants. Tenants can use the app to submit visual maintenance requests by just uploading a photo or a short video of the problem. They can also view their legal contract documents online in a secure environment, and can engage in community services like selling household furniture, setting a play date, or time to walk their dog.

"'HappyTenant will help improve transparency levels and communication between property managers and tenants, which is something the market has been missing for years. As a leading property management platform, with over 5,000 units under management in Dubai and Ajman, and a portfolio value in excess of AED 8 billion, HappyTenant will help improve not only the tenant’s experience in Dubai, but also the owners’ reporting metrics. This matches our vision, which is all about technology, automation, and disruption" added Abdullah Al Ajaji, CEO of Driven Properties.

The building management team can also send building notifications directly to the tenants. The app also gives tenants the added convenience to pay the rents from their smart phones. Overall, 'HappyTenant' Application ensures tenants are happy as they can interact with the real estate agent without any hindrance and their needs are attended more efficiently.
