#### Press Release

HappyTenant, a revolutionary property management application, said it has won top honours at the third edition of the Gulf Real Estate Awards (GREA) which concluded recently in Dubai, UAE.

Since its launch last year, HappyTenant application has continued to redefine the property management industry in the UAE in a smarter way, said a statement.

It is an all-in-one cloud-based, full property management system that allows property agents to take complete control of the day-to-day activities related to their properties and tenants' needs, through one account and a single login.

It combines the best advanced technology to integrate all aspects of property management into a simplified, seamless, accurate and easily trackable real-time information interface that can be conveniently viewed both on computers as well as smart phones, said the company in a statement.

In the recently concluded third edition of the Gulf Real Estate Awards (GREA) held in Dubai, the app was awarded the prestigious 'Best Technology in Real Estate' Award.

Overall, there were 21 category award winners at this year's Gulf Real Estate Awards, said the event organisers.

Organised by Dubai Land Department (DLD) and Awards International, the third edition of the Gulf Real Estate Awards, the Gulf’s most prestigious awards, recognises and rewards excellence across the real estate in the region, they stated.

Built to support property managers’ needs, HappyTenant helps them to stay connected and updated with the progress and financials, whether they are at work or on-the-go, said a top official.

"We believe that a HappyTenant means a happy landlord. That is why we have created an all-in-one, cloud-based solution that has features built specifically for property management requirements," remarked Joe Moufarrej, the co-founder and CEO of 'Happy Tenant' Application.

HappyTenant, he said, was a revolutionary property management application that assures business success by ensuring tenants' happiness.

Gone are the days of confusing spread sheets, messy sticky notes, angry tenant calls and ungainly wall notices as part of daily property management activities, he added.-TradeArabia News Service
