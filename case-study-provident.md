# Why HappyTenant?

We converted to AppFolio in 2012 and have not looked back,” says Brian Hartsell, Broker and Principal at Key Property Management. “Theease of migration from our prior software with your implementation team was seamless. The functionality of the online-based access, direct deposit capabilities, owner/tenant portals and on-the-spot maintenance work orders has given our team the ability to do more efficiently.” Key Property Management also takes full advantage of AppFolio’s integrated marketing features, which allows property managers to post vacancies on many different sites with a single click. “The service to deploy properties to various rental advertising sites has assisted in keeping our vacancy rates at less than 2% annually.”
