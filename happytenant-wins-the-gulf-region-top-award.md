#### Press Release

HappyTenant application has ever since its launch last year continued to redefine the property management industry in the UAE in a smarter way. In the recently concluded third edition of the Gulf Real Estate Awards (GREA) held in Dubai, the app was awarded the prestigious 'Best Technology in Real Estate' Award. It is important to note that HappyTenant competed against the region's most prominent companies from diverse industries to win the coveted award.

Built to support property managers’ needs, HappyTenant helps them to stay connected and updated with the progress and financials, whether they are at work or on-the-go.

"We believe that a HappyTenant means a happy landlord. That is why we have created an all-in-one, cloud-based solution that has features built specifically for property management requirements" said Joe Moufarrej, Co-Founder & CEO of 'Happy Tenant' Application.

Overall, there were twenty-one category award winners at this year's Gulf Real Estate Awards. HappyTenant won an award in the 'Best Technology in Real Estate' category.

GREA follows the directives of HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, to encourage innovation and appreciate innovators, and is in line with Dubai Land Department's (DLD) vision to position Dubai as the world’s premier real estate destination and a byword for innovation, trust, and happiness. ​​​
