# Maximizing operational efficiency is one of the top challenges faced by the property management industry


According to survey data released at the National Apartment Association’s Apartmentalize 2022, over 60% of property managers consider making their day-to-day operations more efficient one of their top three professional challenges.


It isn’t just headcount or revenue that separates winners from losers, the real indicators of enhanced operational efficiency are intelligent resource allocation, higher billable utilization rates, a culture of psychological safety, and a myriad of other factors. Plus, it’s no secret that every business, big and small, want to cuts down on its costs and bring agility to reach towards max revenue capitalization.


According to McKinsey, 79% of the companies have cut costs in response to the global economic crisis, but only 53% think that doing so helped their companies weather it.


But operational efficiency is not the only challenge faced by property managers – staying competitive is another crucial concern for property management companies to retain their business and increase profitability.

6.	Integrated - software should be open for any integration if required so your team doesn’t waste their time on double entries
