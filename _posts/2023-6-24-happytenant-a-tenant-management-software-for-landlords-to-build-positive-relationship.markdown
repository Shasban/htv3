# HappyTenant- A Tenant Management Software for Landlords to Build Positive Relationship


No matter which business you run, clients’ happiness is key to your success in this competitive world. Satisfying your customers will ensure business growth and customer loyalty. 
Yet, things won’t be different for property management, right? So, whether you run a single building and a handful of tenants or multiple communities, proper **tenant management** will ensure your success. But, satisfying every tenant or taking care of their demands, like maintenance requests or rent collection, can be challenging. 
Need help? Presenting **HappyTenant**, a [cloud-based tenant management solution](https://happytenant.io/happy-tenant) for landlords, maintains a positive relationship with tenants and improves their experience! Let’s see how!


## How HappyTenant Helps Landlords With Tenant Management?

Being a landlord, you need to understand your customers’ wishes and requirements to provide them with all the amenities and retain your tenants. Adapting cloud-based tenant management software, like [HappyTenant](https://happytenant.io/), can allow you to run your property seamlessly while ensuring tenants’ satisfaction to the next level. Here’s how:

## #1: Stay connected with your tenants seamlessly 

Since every tenant is different, so are their ever-changing needs. Yet, the best thing you can do is provide your tenants the option to make their rental journey seamless, like being connected to you any time they need. It not just improves your tenants’ satisfaction but your performance. 
Embracing HappyTenant allows landlords to offer their tenants an online portal to access from anywhere and directly connect with them through that app while recording communication history. Also, you can send live announcements here and keep them updated with new amenities or closures-related matters. 
In fact, your tenants will get automated alerts and reminders through it for maintenance, late payment, and even fire alarm testing, so they never miss out on anything important. Overall, this **tenant management software** encourages a strong and positive bonding between you and your tenants. 

## #2: Ease their tenancy with advanced technology

Tenants usually complain about communication or service delays. But when you handle so many buildings and tenants together, you will probably miss out on several maintenance requests or queries. 
In this case, implementing HappyTenant can empower your tenants not just to engage with you or stay informed of live announcements but beyond that. For example:

- Online rent payments using debit or credit cards
- Create and schedule maintenance or service requests online while reviewing if the request is assigned to the vendors
- Accessing the payment history, receipts, and communication records
- Receiving alerts of pending rents
- Easy access to the maintenance projects and condition reports, unit specifications, and furnishing details
- Getting reminders of expired documents

So, say goodbye to frequent calls, messages, and paper notices! On the contrary, you won’t ever miss maintenance requests from your tenants, facilitate their requests on time and maintain a positive relationship with your tenants. 

## #3: Adding personalized message

Making your tenants feel special is always the best way to retain them and make a positive relationship with them. With HappyTenant, tenant management gets easier! You can send a personalized message to your new tenants and welcome them to the online portal or greet your old tenants on their birthdays or other special days on this digital platform. 
Moreover, you can let them enjoy a socially active lifestyle during the tenancy period by connecting them with neighbors by scheduling BBQs or play dates. 

## #4: Allow your tenants to give suggestions

By embracing HappyTenant, you can give your tenants a voice to give feedback on your service. They can rate their experience interacting with landlords and even third-party services, including cleaning, laundry, handyman, etc. You can gain insight into those ratings and real-time data to act and improve accordingly. 


In a Nutshell

In this competitive world, investing in HappyTenant, a cloud-based tenant management software for landlords, can streamline your property management seamlessly and easier compared to traditional approaches. You can improve your tenants' satisfaction and build a positive relationship by implementing this PMS, even when juggling several tasks.
