## What Are Digital Maintenance Requests?

- Ticket creation  
- Task assignment  
- Reminder notifications  
- Real-time tracking  

Unlike many platforms, HappyTenant also gives tenants the ability to pick their preferred options when submitting maintenance or parking-related issues.

## Why Digital Maintenance Requests Are Essential in 2025

Automation is no longer optional—it’s the new industry standard. With AI-powered systems becoming mainstream, manual tracking slows down operations and leads to errors.

Studies show global financial automation is expected to grow by more than [14% by 2032](https://www.venasolutions.com/blog/automation-statistics), proving that digital transformation is accelerating across industries.

For property managers, it shows that the future belongs to platforms that improve management and reduce manual effort. So, instead of relying on less effective ways, landlords should stay aligned with modern expectations.
