# Student Housing Management Made Easy - Discover How


For any **student housing property manager**, overseeing multiple occupants across different units while managing maintenance, inspections, billing and all is no simple task. Without the proper tools in place, student housing management can quickly become an administrative nightmare.

However, new-age robust solutions are emerging to help simplify operations for managers of student accommodations.


### What Student Housing Requires

Unlike conventional rentals, student housing has unique needs when it comes to property management. With entire units rented out by the bed, communicating with all tenants is essential yet challenging. Additionally, with constant tenant turnover, maintenance requests, unit inspections and rent collection require specialized coordination.

Managing this web of multi-occupant communication, visual tracking of unit issues, rent payment options tailored to students, document storage and more is extremely difficult without a streamlined system. Trying to handle it all using transitional methods like spreadsheets and paper filing leads to frustrated managers, tenants and property owners.

### So, what’s The Solution?

Property managers need robust **property management Software** or PMS to streamline the student housing property management process.

Let’s see how this **student housing property management software** can benefit property managers.

- ### Multi-Occupant Communication

Connecting with all tenants in a unit is made simple through centralized portals to submit requests, access notices and contact management. Robust property management software provides customized tenant login portals to file maintenance requests, view community updates, message management and more regardless of how many occupants are in a unit. This facilitates seamless two-way interaction.

- ### Online Rent Payment

Customized rent payment processing, variable scheduling options and automated billing statements simplify rent collection across multiple student occupants. Robust PMS Software creates scheduled payments or charges for security deposits, accommodating split payments from tenants. This allows online payments via mobile and generating billing statements itemizing charges for every tenant.

- ### Visual Maintenance and Inspections

**PMS software** offers detailed maintenance tracking logs with unlimited documentation storage along with calendar scheduling. Every maintenance request and resolution is logged digitally with corresponding documents. This helps in creating visual histories of every unit issue. And, digital tracking allows for easily generating inspection reports, assessing recurring problems and identifying inspection trends across properties.

- ### Smart Notifications

Real-time email or SMS alerts are another perk of student housing management. This helps to indicate work orders exceeding target resolution times, overdue rent payments, expiring leases and more. And, property managers can also generate customized notifications to automate reminders for payments, send inspection summaries, and new maintenance requests, etc. Automatic notifications reduce the manual follow-up required to stay on task.

- ### Document Storage
