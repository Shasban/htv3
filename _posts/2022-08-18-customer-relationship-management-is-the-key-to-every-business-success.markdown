# Customer relationship management is the key to every business's success!


At its core, Customer relationship management is basically a combination of several activities, strategies and technologies that companies use to interact with their Customers and build relationships. 

#### A saying frequently heard and said in many businesses is "Customer is king."


Its Customers' relationship building creates loyalty and Customer retention – be it any business in any industry. But if we look specifically into the property management industry, this business particularly is 100% dependent on Customer relationship management and not just on one front but on two fronts – landlords management and tenant management – this makes CRM activities crucial for their business growth and sustainability.


Now back in days, this relationship management required an army of relationship managers who were dedicated to nurturing these stakeholder relationships manually without any tech presence. But with PropTech bringing digital revolutions and especially in the post-pandemic era when people are more than ready to adapt to technology, Customer management can be simplified with digitalization and transparency.
