# How Do Digital Leases and E-Signatures Work?

Managing leases manually is no longer practical for modern landlords and property managers. With growing rental demand and expanding property portfolios, paperwork and physical signatures are slow and increase the risk of errors. HappyTenant resolves the issue by offering a digital lease management system with built-in e-signature functionality.

## What Is a Digital Lease HappyTenant?

A digital lease in [HappyTenant](https://happytenant.io/) means the entire process happens online, from creation to approval and signing. Landlords can manage lease details, approvals, and signatures within one secure and centralized platform. Instead of printing or emailing documents, everything stays organized, accessible, and easy to manage. Digital leases help landlords by:

- Reducing manual work and everyday administrative effort
- Preventing document loss with secure digital storage
- Tracking lease status and approvals in real-time
- Improving the tenant experience through faster, more transparent communication

## Step-By-Step Guide for Users

Managing digital leases becomes much easier when you understand each step of the process clearly. This guide walks [HappyTenant](https://happytenant.io/) users through creating, activating, and signing leases online to streamline approvals while keeping everything organized in one place.

### Creating a Lease Draft in HappyTenant

The process starts from the Leasing section on the HappyTenant dashboard. Click on Leasing to open a dropdown menu showing Dashboard, All Leases, Drafts, Active, and Completed. Select Dashboard, where you will see the Add Lease button at the top. Clicking this button opens the lease creation form.

While creating a lease, you can add the following details:

- Tenant or multiple tenants
- Property and unit details
- Lease duration and type
- Rent amount and payment schedule
- Lease category (residential or commercial)
- Dubai tenancy lease information for compliance
- Optional custom fields, such as registration numbers or bond details

After filling in all required information, click "Save Lease" to store the lease securely. The system automatically saves it in draft mode, allowing you to review details, make edits, and finalize the lease before activation.

You can access the draft leases in the leasing subsection labeled "Drafts" for convenience. By selecting your lease ID, you can carefully review all details, update information, and fill in any missing sections efficiently. These also provide an opportunity to prepare the lease fully before sharing it with tenants for approval.

### Activating the Lease

1. Complete all required fields in the draft to ensure the lease is ready for activation.
2. Click the action button in the top-right corner, then select "Activate Lease".
3. The draft immediately becomes an official lease visible to tenants in the Tenant App.
4. Once active, it enables invoicing, rent tracking, and monitoring of renewal requests or responses.
5. Activating the lease also unlocks digital signing options, streamlining the process for landlords and tenants.

### Sending the Lease for Tenant E-Signature

In HappyTenant, e-signature functionality is accessed through the "Print Lease" option. When you click on it, you are taken to a dedicated lease approval page where digital signing is managed. This is where HappyTenant's e-signature workflow begins.

1. Open the activated lease from the active subsection in your account dashboard.
2. Click the "Print Lease" button located in the top-right corner of the screen.
3. Confirm tenant details, assign landlord information, and choose an approved lease template.
4. Click "Save" to proceed, which redirects you to the page with further actions.
5. Select "Send for Tenant Signature" to deliver the lease digitally to the tenant.
6. The tenant receives a notification via the Tenant App or email to review and sign.
7. They can then review all details and complete the lease signing securely online.

### Tenant-First Signature & Landlord Auto-Sign

HappyTenantfollows a tenant-first signing flow. Here's how it works:

- The tenant signs the lease digitally
- Once the tenant signs, the system can automatically apply the landlord's signature (if enabled)
- The lease is marked as signed and approved
- This ensures faster approvals and removes the need for back-and-forth communication.

### Tracking Signature Status

After sending the lease for signature, you can:

- Monitor whether the tenant has signed
- Track lease approval progress
- View signing activity within the lease record

Once finished, the finalized lease is stored digitally in HappyTenant. This eliminates the need for physical filing and makes lease retrieval instant.

## Conclusion

Digital leases with HappyTenant make managing properties faster, simpler, and fully paperless. Landlords can track approvals, monitor progress, and store records securely. However, tenants enjoy instant access and timely notifications that build trust and enhance satisfaction.
