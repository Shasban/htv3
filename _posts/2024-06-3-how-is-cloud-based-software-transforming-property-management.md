# How Is Cloud-Based Software Transforming Property Management 


The way property managers handle things is changing. They are using cloud-based software to improve how they operate all the property management hassles. But what does it mean to have "cloud-based" property management software? And what are the main benefits causing this shift?

This article explains how cloud-based PMS helps property managers in many ways.

**Cloud-based PMS in a Nutshell**

**Cloud property management software** refers to applications hosted on remote servers and accessed via the internet. For property managers, this means the software and important information is available anywhere on the internet. They don't need an office full of computers and file cabinets.

This online access makes property management operations easier in many ways. And, it saves time on tasks and costs on hardware. Using this software managers can benefit from automated features like online rent collection and maintenance requests, etc. Besides, lease agreements, and payment history are also available 24/7 through online portals.

Now, let’s explore the benefits of **Cloud-Based Property Management Software**


### Increased Efficiency and Productivity

Cloud property management software centralizes all critical information and workflows into a single, easily-accessible system. Managers no longer have to dig through filing cabinets to access tenant details, lease agreements or records. It's all available with the click of a button.

Tis robust PMS software has automated features like rent collection, invoice generation and maintenance request tracking, etc. All these can eliminate tedious administrative work. Managers can focus on their efforts on high-value tasks like building tenant relationships and planning long-term strategy.

### Enhanced Security and Compliance

For property managers, data security is a top priority when handling sensitive tenant information. **[Cloud property management system](https://happytenant.io/product/happytenant-app)** offers robust protection against data breaches and loss.

Leading cloud providers use advanced security measures like encryption, multi-factor authentication and regular backups. Data storage is distributed across multiple facilities which minimizes disruption from localized technical issues or natural disasters.

### Scalability and Adaptability

Property management portfolios are dynamic, with new properties, units and tenants added continuously. **[Cloud-based PMS software](https://happytenant.io/)** seamlessly adapts to this growth and change with unlimited scalability.

Managers can instantly add new properties, adjust floorplans, track additional assets and onboard users without costly development projects. The system stays efficient and adaptable as property portfolios grow bigger.

The cloud also enables anywhere access on any device. Managers can work from home, the office or on-site with the same system access. This flexibility is invaluable.

### Cost Savings and Sustainability

Cloud PMS platforms greatly reduce upfront capital expenditures on servers and hardware needed for on-premise systems. Instead, managers pay predictable monthly fees and scale costs based on usage.

With the cloud, there is no need to periodically upgrade hardware. The cloud-based system providers handle all upgrades behind the scenes. So property managers can spend money on serving tenants rather than on maintenance.

### Enhanced Tenant Experience

Tenants today expect instant access to information and responsive service. Cloud software enables this experience via online tenant portals.

Tenants can log in anytime to view balances, make payments, submit work orders and communicate with managers. Automated notifications keep them informed of account activity.

This self-service and transparency results in satisfied tenants, stronger retention, and word-of-mouth marketing.
